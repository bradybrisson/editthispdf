EditThisPDF.com offers a simple open source solution for making quick, minor edits to PDF documents. One standout feature is the “Whiteout” tool, just like the traditional correction fluid but digital. Users can easily cover up unwanted text and type their own content over the whiteout area, mimicking the experience of editing with pen and paper.

This straightforward approach eliminates the need for expensive subscription based software from large companies like Adobe, saving users time, money, and hassle.
